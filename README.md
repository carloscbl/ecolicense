# Ecolicense
WIP of a license to distribute software in a reasonable manner with (for now) our only planet.

## Description
This is part of the ecolicense.org and the maybe future ecolicense fundation? effort to provide a clean and sustainable way to software makers across the globe to make an impact in the world with it software.

## Fundamentals
Fast software is cheaper and more ecological, pushing polluting/inneficient companies to pay for quality software, will push their maths/inversions to the ecological/innovative path

## How
We will publish a index with per industry, per year, set of umbrals that your project license can adhere.
We are a license wrapper!
Within this umbrals, industries can use your free software with the license that you want to use MIT, GPLV3, Commercial...
Exceed the umbrals, you can apply restrictions, like a license payment, donation, or requirements of an organization perform a green action, inversion or donation.

## Example!
Auto car makers can't use your libraries in a car that is not EV, or with a rate of emmisions lesser than NEDC: 70â€“80 g/km in the year of release.

## But the money!
We want to industries take this seriously as serious as is software in the world.
So we want to persue within the law any infractions to our earth planet, (mars is free of us for now)
And maybe allow third persons reports and/or investigations and lawsuits, by letting them get the amount of the penalty fee in a 80% lawsuiters, 15% owner of the code, 5% ecolicense fundation. Always with code owner permision and agreement of shares.

## For what is the money!?
Cover operation costs, expand and invest in eco software, improve and fund eco software to have lesser footprint and better eficiency and to innovate in other areas of environment impact.

## As Software maker what i can do?
Adopt the Ecolicense! Reach us if you want help or you want to push it within your organization
